Azure Kubernetes Workshop Guide 
===
In this lab, youâ€™ll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy a multi-container application to Kubernetes on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/?wt.mc_id=aksworkshop).

Some of the things you'll be going through:

* Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress
* Deploying MongoDB using Helm version 3
* Azure Container Registry to push/pull your private images
* Azure Monitor for Containers, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler(HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler

## Prerequisites 
The following are the basic requirements to **start** the labs. Individual labs may have other requirements that will be listed within the lab.

* Azure Account [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
* Git [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Azure Cloud Shell [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com)

## Application Overview
You will be deploying a customer-facing order placement and fulfillment application that is containerized and is architected for a microservice implementation.
